WHAT: trying to seperate rock from water

ndwi doesn't work.
looked at https://landsat.usgs.gov/spectral-characteristics-viewer for help
bands 2 & 7 don't work



Stuff to generate localized filter histograms of:
* Clear water
* Turbid water
* Unvegetated rocky stuff
* Snow & ice
* Vegetated flat area

One-to-one function mapping pixel coords to geographic coords for a given file

Used photoshop to make an RBG 654 of the training landscape. 
Manually adjusted and selected bodies of water using magic selection tool. Went back across the coastline and tweaked it just to be on the safe side.

K-means, doesn't need percise pixel definitions. Just loose representation of the range of values in the whole set. Clustering-based.

Using ArcMap... doesn't seem to support more than 3 channels being looked at
Trying to implement it in python, found some libraries
This is too frustrating, I'm going to Matlab
I'll have to recreate everything in matlab. Back to python
I'm just going to write my own algorithm
This is very slow even for extremely small samples
Something's going wrong since I added in new thingsy

Need 32 bit python for arcmap. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33709391/using-multiple-python-engines-32bit-64bit-and-2-7-3-5

set CONDA_FORCE_32BIT=1
activate py27_32

python in the conda IDLE shell, then use execfile() to run scripts.

Seed image: a core of good images to start throwing garbage at once we're confident there's no false negs.

1) Focus on a small area (067, 017)
2) Choose your cloud, snow, illumination carefully
3) Increase time span (LS 5)
